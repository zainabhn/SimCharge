with explicit support for mobile charging stations (MCSs).

## Features
- Configurable area of interest and meeting point layouts
- EV and MCS agent modeling
- Random, greedy, and RSMB auction allocation baselines
- Plug-and-play support for custom allocation mechanisms
- Real-time visualization and metric logging
